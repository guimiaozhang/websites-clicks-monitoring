# Monitering Multivariate Negative Binomial with Machine Learning Methods

This is my master degree project. R is the main coding language whereas Python was employed while first attemps to construct 3-D plots.

Only generalized functions to process and analyze data using different methods has been uploaded as "functions.R".

Other detailed codeing can be sent if needed.

The full report was attached.
